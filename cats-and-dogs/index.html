    <h1>Cats and Dogs</h1>
    <h4 style="color: rgba(121, 111, 111, 0.87);">I have a cat, and am thinking of getting a dog. Will they fight?</h4>
    <p>The idea that dogs hate cats may have been born because dogs chase cats and grew because cartons depicted ongoing battles between the two speciies. Or it may have been generated because some dog peoople strong;ly dislike cats and some cat people disdain dogs. However, dogs and cats can live peacefully as long as owners understand the behaviours of each</p>
    <p>In some cases, a resident cat will isolate itself when a puppy is added to the family. In other cases, cat and dogs never get used to each other. In still other cases, cat or kitten and dog or puppy play together and build a frinedship that finds them curled up together in a crate or bed and drinking out of the same bowl. The type of relationship developed in each household depends on the personality of the animals and the understanding of the owners.</p>
